Hey what have you been up to
Oh We went to a selfdefense class today

36
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:37,447
Wow

37
00:02:37,615 --> 00:02:41,535
Yeah Kicking a guy in the crotch
all morning really takes it out of you

38
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:43,996

40
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:50,043
After one class I dont think so

41
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:52,921
What you wanna see me
selfdefend myself

42
00:02:53,089 --> 00:02:55,424
Go over there
and pretend youre a sexual predator

43
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:57,342
Go on I dare you

44
00:02:58,094 --> 00:03:01,930
Of course you can defend yourself
from an attack you know is coming

45
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:03,932
Thats not enough

46
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:07,394
Look I studied karate for a long time

47
00:03:08,938 --> 00:03:11,690
And theres a concept
you should really be familiar with

48
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:16,236
Its what the Japanese call unagi

49
00:03:18,072 --> 00:03:19,990
Isnt that a kind of sushi

50
00:03:21,242 --> 00:03:25,329
No its a concept
Yeah it is it is Its freshwater eel

51
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:27,456
All right maybe it means that too

52
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:30,751
Oh I would kill
for a salmonskin roll right now

53
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:35,172
You know what Fine get attacked
I dont even care

54
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:39,092
Come on Ross were sorry
Please tell us what it is

55
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:46,391
Unagi is a state of total awareness

56
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:49,186
Okay Only by achieving true unagi

57
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:53,941
can you be prepared
for any danger that may befall you

58
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:57,402
In case someones trying
to steal your bamboo sleeping mat

59
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:58,612
or your kettle of fish

60
00:03:58,780 --> 00:03:59,821

61
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:02,616

62
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:05,702
All Im saying is
its one thing being prepared

63
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:07,871
for an attack against like each other

64
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:10,874
Whole other story being prepared
for an attack I dont know

65
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:12,834
A surprise

66
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:26,265
All right you knew that was coming
but that doesnt mean you have unagi

67
00:04:29,185 --> 00:04:32,771
Ooh if we made reservations
we could have unagi in about a halfhour

68
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,523
You know what

69
00:04:36,317 --> 00:04:38,443

76
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:07,014

77
00:05:07,181 --> 00:05:09,182
