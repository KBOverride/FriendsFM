162
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:52,484
Obviously So how do we decide

163
00:10:52,693 --> 00:10:56,196
Well now

164
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:58,740

00:11:00,534 --> 00:11:02,035

00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:37,862
Maybe Ill take her
to that new French restaurant down the street

176
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:41,533
Wait a second
We have to set a spending limit on the date

177
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:44,577
I dont have the money to take her
to a fancy place like that

178
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:48,665
Well sorry
Thats what I do on dates

179
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:53,461

00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:24,028
technically I didnt break any rules
Thanks for stopping by though

220
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:27,657

222
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:33,663

224
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:37,041

00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:41,963
Hey So just a light layer

226
00:14:42,172 --> 00:14:44,841
Yeah just here and there

227
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:55,059
Joey got meat sauce
on the banister again

228
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:58,271
Swing music is so out

229
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,941
Phoebe hes gotta be in the room
for that to work

230
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:05,320
What are you guys talking about

231
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:08,031
Were talking about The Swing Kings

232
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:10,992
and whether theyre
the right way to go

233
00:15:11,201 --> 00:15:13,870
I went to a wedding
where they had swing music

234
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:16,497
and two months later
the couple divorced

235
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:21,169
Im not saying
theres any connection here

236
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:24,756
but they did tell me
thats why they got divorced

237
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:28,134
But I love swing music

238
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:30,011
But The Swing Kings

239
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:35,642
They suck so much that people actually die
at their concerts They just stop living

240
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:39,729
When Monica and I went to see them
we had fun

241
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,689
And theres another reason

242
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:46,194
Well what is the other reason
I dont want to say

243
00:15:46,403 --> 00:15:49,989
Well you have to
because maybe its stupid

244
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:55,870
Its just while Monica and I
were dancing to them

245
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:59,290
it was the first time
I knew that

246
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:04,337
you were the woman that I wanted
to dance all my dances with

247
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:09,092
Oh crap

248
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:20,770
Our table will be ready in just a few minutes
Oh great

249
00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:24,232
Is your back feeling better
Yeah its fine

250
00:16:24,441 --> 00:16:27,235
I guess ahem the more muscles you have

251
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:30,905
the more they can
spasm out of control

252
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:34,784
Kristen
Joey

253
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:36,536

Are you on TV or something

264
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:21,289
Joey doesnt like to talk about it

265
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:24,959
but hes one of the stars
of Days of Our Lives

266
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:30,006
Thats right Thats right
Dont you play a woman

267
00:17:32,968 --> 00:17:36,054
A woman in a mans body

268
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:38,389
Much better

269
00:17:39,516 --> 00:17:42,602
So Ross its funny because you
look familiar to me too

270
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:45,354
Have you ever been married

271
00:17:47,107 --> 00:17:48,149
Yes I have

272
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,651
In fact just the other day

273
00:17:50,861 --> 00:17:55,031
Kris and I talked about how
Ive been married and have a son

274
00:17:55,282 --> 00:17:59,327
Yeah little Eric
Thats right Wait No Ben

275
00:18:01,955 --> 00:18:05,166
So youve just been married
the one time then

276
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:11,297
Well um
Youve been married twice

277
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:15,259
Yes And

278
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:18,179
another time after that

279
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:23,226
Boy Im getting hungry

280
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:26,562
Ahem Hey Joey have you ever been
so hungry on a date

281
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:31,234
that when the girl goes to the
bathroom you eat some of her food

282
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:36,948
You said the waiter ate my crab cake

283
00:18:37,699 --> 00:18:38,783

284
00:18:39,034 --> 00:18:43,913
So Ross now why did
that first marriage break up Hm

285
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:49,210
Was it because the woman was straight
or because she was a lesbian

286
00:18:50,712 --> 00:18:53,923
Do you two know each other
ROSS  JOEY No

287
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:56,968
But he seems like
a guy whod marry a woman

288
00:18:57,177 --> 00:19:01,722
on the verge of being a lesbian
and then push her over the edge

289
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:09,272
Wait a minute
Were you on a poster for gonorrhea

290
00:19:12,025 --> 00:19:15,653
Have you ever slept
in the same bed with a monkey

291
00:19:16,446 --> 00:19:18,781

296
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:43,139
