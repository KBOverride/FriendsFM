163
00:10:39,221 --> 00:10:40,930
What were you thinking

164
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:43,016
I didnt know it was an auction

165
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:44,643
I figured Id take a guess

166
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:48,188
Help a charity Free boat

167
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:51,024
Why would a charity
give away a free boat

168
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:53,985
I dont know Charity
Oh

169
00:10:55,112 --> 00:10:57,530
Well just buy the damn boat

170
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:01,368
Phoebe dont you think
youve had enough to drink

171
00:11:01,535 --> 00:11:03,662
Im just helping the kids

172
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:07,666
How is you drinking helping the kids

173
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:11,836
Because the more I drink the less
there is for the kids to drink

174
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:19,177
Mr Tribbiani
Your contribution brings us

175
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:21,846
a big step closer
to building the youth center

176
00:11:22,306 --> 00:11:25,100
Just out of curiosity
how much is that boat worth

177
00:11:25,267 --> 00:11:27,143
I think it was valued at 1 9000

178
00:11:27,311 --> 00:11:29,771
Hey I was pretty close

179
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:35,193
Uh so bad news

180
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:39,531
Um I cant buy the boat
I dont have any money

181
00:11:41,742 --> 00:11:42,784

182
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:45,870

You cant leave Joey

186
00:11:58,217 --> 00:12:01,386
You agreed to buy that boat
It is a contract

187
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:04,222
Plus if you leave
my boss is gonna kill me

188
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:07,350
Well what am I gonna do Rach
I dont have that kind of money

189
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:09,269

190
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:10,687
This is what well do

191
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:14,649
Well go to the next highest bidder
and well let them buy it

192
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:17,026
Then youre just gonna
pay the difference

193
00:12:17,194 --> 00:12:18,236
Okay

194
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:21,448
I dont know why the kids need a
youth center anyway

195
00:12:21,615 --> 00:12:26,286
They should just watch TV after school
like I did And I turned out fine

196
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:28,413
Not great

197
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:33,126
So were hiding in the bathroom

198
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:36,796
Then I sneak out But before
Monica can her parents come in

199
00:12:36,964 --> 00:12:39,007
I hid in the shower
next thing you know

200
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:41,217
theyre going at it on the floor

201
00:12:41,385 --> 00:12:42,677
Oh my God

202
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:44,179
I got a good one

203
00:12:44,346 --> 00:12:48,641
I once walked in on both my parents
making love to the same guy

204
00:12:54,815 --> 00:12:59,194
Its so great seeing you guys again
Id like to make a toast

205
00:12:59,361 --> 00:13:03,323
Uh as a poet once said
ln the sweetness of friendship

206
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:06,618
let there be laughter
and sharing of pleasures

207
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:08,995
for in the dew of little things

208
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:12,123
the heart finds its morning and is
refreshed

209
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:13,458
Aw

210
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,211
What

211
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:25,762
Oh my God You guys

212
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:30,016
Before you say anything have we got a story
for you Guess who we bumped into

213
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:32,185
Who
Richard

214
00:13:32,728 --> 00:13:35,230
Oh Oh

215
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:38,066
I thought you were going out
with Elizabeth

216
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:42,028
I was Uh she was a little busy
with a water balloon fight

217
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:45,532
Sometimes grownups have commitments
they cant get out of

218
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,910
Maybe she is too young for me

219
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:53,373
When I was over there
I felt like I was a babysitter

220
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:57,919
I finally see what you were talking
about I dont know what to do

221
00:13:58,087 --> 00:14:01,506
Just weigh the good stuff about
the relationship against the bad

222
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:05,885
Thats what I did when I first started
weighing stuff

223
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:11,933
Okay um bad stuff
Im 1 2 years older than she is

224
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:13,893
If school finds out youre fired

225
00:14:14,061 --> 00:14:17,063
Shes leaving for three months
For camp

226
00:14:18,607 --> 00:14:20,567
Okay good stuff Um

227
00:14:20,734 --> 00:14:23,695
Well shes sweet and pretty and

228
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:27,949
The only question you need to ask
is do you see a future

229
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:31,202
Do you see yourself marrying her

230
00:14:31,787 --> 00:14:34,956
My God You did it already
You married her didnt you

231
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:40,336
No I didnt do that
Its just

232
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:45,842
Honestly no
I dont see a big future with her

233
00:14:46,802 --> 00:14:49,220
Okay I think thats your answer

234
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:52,390
I gotta talk to her
I hate this part

235
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:55,018
Forget Elizabeth
If youre not careful

236
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:58,563
you may not get married
at all this year

237
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:03,735

283
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:50,276
A palm reader a manicurist

Glove salesman

Yeah Convince her youre scared
of commitment

289
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:11,881
I can do that
Ive had 30 years of practice

290
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:14,092
Being you is finally gonna pay off

291
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,137
Had to go to the basement

292
00:18:18,388 --> 00:18:21,974

ROSS Wow I have never had
such a healthy breakup

297
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:50,628
She was such a grownup about it

298
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:54,132
She didnt seem too immature for me

299
00:18:54,883 --> 00:18:58,344
Did I just make a huge mistake

300
00:18:58,512 --> 00:19:00,096
Ross Wait

301
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:03,724
Elizabeth thank God

00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:17,780
Breakups still on

306
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:20,616

307
00:19:25,747 --> 00:19:26,873
Here she comes

308
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,667
Do I look like a guy
who doesnt want to get married

309
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:31,335
Yeah

310
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:34,130
And also a little like a
French guy

311
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:39,135
I never noticed that before

312
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:42,388
Hey guys
JOEY Hey

313
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:43,681
What are you up to

314
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:46,934
Just hanging out
Talking about uh web sites

315
00:19:47,102 --> 00:19:48,144
Ha

316
00:19:48,812 --> 00:19:52,440
Ahem We saw this interesting website
about marriage

317
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:54,775
How unnecessary it is

318
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:57,778
How its a way for governments
to keep tabs on you

319
00:19:57,988 --> 00:19:59,739
Yeah Big Brother Ha ha

320
00:20:01,074 --> 00:20:02,408
Thats a little crazy

321
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:07,038
Although I am glad youre looking
at other things on the Internet

322
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:11,709
Got me thinking why would anybody
want to get married

323
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:16,130
Why To celebrate the relationship
To solidify the commitment

324
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:19,133
To declare your love for one another
to the world

325
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:21,344
Eh

326
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:25,097
Okay Well thats good to know

327
00:20:25,265 --> 00:20:26,724
