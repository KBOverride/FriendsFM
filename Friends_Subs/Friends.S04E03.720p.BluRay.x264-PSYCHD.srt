10
00:00:34,284 --> 00:00:35,909
Could we be more white trash

11
00:01:26,711 --> 00:01:28,754
How desperate am I

12
00:01:29,005 --> 00:01:32,257
Oh good thing Chandlers not here

13
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:35,469
I just told my mom
Id cater her party for her

14
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:38,138
How come
Because I need the money

15
00:01:38,306 --> 00:01:42,810
And I thought itd be a great way to get rid
of that last little smidgen of selfrespect

16
00:01:42,977 --> 00:01:44,937
Come on I think this is a good thing

17
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:46,688
I dont think Mom wouldve hired you

18
00:01:46,856 --> 00:01:48,857
if she didnt think you were good
at what you do

19
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:52,444
You dont have to stick up for her
She cant hear you

20
00:01:54,864 --> 00:01:57,032
Hey um do you guys have any juice

21
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,575

22
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:01,703
Hey uh Rach Funny story

23
00:02:01,871 --> 00:02:03,789
I bumped into Joanna
on the street yesterday

24
00:02:04,874 --> 00:02:07,543
My boss Joanna
Wow that must have been awkward

25
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:10,420
Well no Actually she asked me
if I wanted to get a drink

26
00:02:10,588 --> 00:02:12,214

27
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:15,134
You uh didnt say yes to that did you

28
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:18,554
Ha ha No No

29
00:02:18,721 --> 00:02:20,347
Hello Rachel

30
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:26,103
Well not at first

31
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:29,273
What is she doing here

32
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,316

33
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:36,238
I dont understand

34
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:38,574
Last time you went out with her
you said she was a dud

35
00:02:38,741 --> 00:02:40,200
I think I judged her too quickly

36
00:02:40,368 --> 00:02:43,579
And this time we were able
to take the relationship to the next level

37
00:02:43,746 --> 00:02:45,914

38
00:02:46,749 --> 00:02:51,378
Well last time I almost got fired
You must end it You must end it now

39
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:53,922
Its not like this is an everyday occurrence
for me

40
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:56,466
I mean usually Im pretty much
in there by myself

41
00:02:56,634 --> 00:02:59,094

42
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:02,973
RACHEL

Okay I promise Ill end it
Thank you

45
00:03:10,064 --> 00:03:11,899
But I hope you know
what Im giving up for you

46
00:03:12,066 --> 00:03:14,484
Because shes not just the boss
in your office

47
00:03:14,652 --> 00:03:16,153
You know what I mean

48
00:03:16,487 --> 00:03:17,779
Yeah

49
00:03:20,825 --> 00:03:22,492
Oh sorry I knew what he meant

50
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:29,875
Hows the hired help

51
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,502
Doing great Quiches are coming along

52
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:34,796
Whats this Blue nail polish

53
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:37,758
Yeah I thought it was cute

54
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:41,386
Ha Its what your grandmothers hands
looked like when we found her

55
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:46,516
Let me ask you a question

56
00:03:46,976 --> 00:03:48,185
Why did you hire me

57
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:51,396
Oh well Richard raved
about the food at his party

58
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:53,315
of course you were sleeping with him

59
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:56,860
Then I heard the food at that
lesbian wedding was very nice

60
00:03:57,028 --> 00:03:59,947
I assume you werent sleeping
with anyone there

61
00:04:00,114 --> 00:04:02,491
Though
at least that would be something

62
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:07,037
Oh my God Did you hear that

63
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:09,706
She hired me because
she thinks Im good

64
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:13,502
Okay I didnt hear that

65
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:17,256
Yeah She didnt hire me out of pity

66
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:19,675
It wasnt so she could pick on me
in front of her friends

67
00:04:19,842 --> 00:04:21,593
She actually thinks Im good

68
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:25,347
Wow And hey its cool if youre a lesbian
Ha ha

69
00:04:35,024 --> 00:04:36,817

70
00:04:40,738 --> 00:04:44,032
Good afternoon Are you
the decisionmaker of the house

71
00:04:44,575 --> 00:04:45,951
Uh

72
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:53,417
Do you uh currently own
a set of encyclopedias

73
00:04:53,584 --> 00:04:57,546
No no but uh try the classifieds
People sell everything in there

74
00:04:57,714 --> 00:05:00,674
Actually Im not buying Im selling

75
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:02,718
Let me ask you one question

76
00:05:03,219 --> 00:05:05,721
Do your friends ever have
a conversation

77
00:05:05,888 --> 00:05:07,389
and you just nod along

78
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:10,434
even though youre not really sure
what theyre talking about

79
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:18,233
Im telling you
its totally unconstitutional

80
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:20,652
I hear you Yeah it is
I totally agree

81
00:05:22,238 --> 00:05:24,448
I think he deserves a Nobel Prize

82
00:05:24,615 --> 00:05:26,408
GROUP
No

83
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:31,246
It was like the Algonquin kids table

84
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:32,539

85
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:36,960

Oh I know I never wear fake ones

92
00:05:53,394 --> 00:05:56,188
I just did it so my mom wouldnt
give me grief about biting them

93
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:59,566
No I meant its weird that
you only have nine now

94
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:04,112
Oh my God

95
00:06:05,114 --> 00:06:06,615
Wait a minute

96
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:08,575

00:06:20,963 --> 00:06:24,466
Oh Oh its because theyre gonna eat
Thats the problem

102

Okay uh please dont freak out

104
00:06:33,142 --> 00:06:37,145
Um but theres a blue fingernail
in one of the quiche cups

105
00:06:37,313 --> 00:06:39,731
And theres no way to know which one

106
00:06:42,026 --> 00:06:45,612
And whoever finds it wins the prize

107
00:06:46,447 --> 00:06:48,323
Ha ha Im not freaking out

108
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:49,658

00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:06,842
So all that stuff about hiring me
because I was good was

115
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:08,552
No that was all true

116
00:07:08,719 --> 00:07:11,513
This was just in case you
pulled a Monica

117
00:07:12,056 --> 00:07:15,684
You promised Dr Weinberg
youd never use that phrase

118
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:18,186
Honey come on Have a sense of humor

00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:42,450
And the fact that you were jeopardizing
my career never entered your mind

I can be very generous

318
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:36,614

Yes

325
00:19:01,765 --> 00:19:05,393
Its hard to believe just a little while ago
this was nothing but ingredients

326
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:10,106
Everyone seems to like your dish

327
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:11,858
And you

328
00:19:12,025 --> 00:19:13,943
I thought it was

329
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:16,445
quite tasty

330
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:20,741
So if everyone liked it and you liked it

331
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:24,203
that would make this a success
Which would make you

332
00:19:24,454 --> 00:19:25,913
A bitch

333
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:29,834
Well I was going for wrong
but we can use your word

334
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,921
Yes well I was wrong

335
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:36,257

She doesnt know we switched it

340
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:54,984
And the next time you cater for me

00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,404
there will be nothing but ice
in the freezer

342
00:19:58,947 --> 00:20:00,948
Well that really means a lot

343
00:20:01,116 --> 00:20:03,201
