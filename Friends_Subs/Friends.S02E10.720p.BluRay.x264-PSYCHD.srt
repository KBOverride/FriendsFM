1
00:00:06,297 --> 00:00:07,381
Joey would you slow down

2
00:00:07,549 --> 00:00:10,259
Theyre not gonna be sold out of papers
at 100 in the morning

3
00:00:10,468 --> 00:00:13,053
Im excited
Ive never gotten reviewed before

4
00:00:13,263 --> 00:00:16,807
You were so amazing as the king
Im really impressed I was

5
00:00:17,058 --> 00:00:18,308
But you know what

6
00:00:18,518 --> 00:00:21,020
You might wanna consider
wearing underwear next time

7
00:00:21,563 --> 00:00:24,940
Because when you sat on your throne
you could kind of see your

8
00:00:25,191 --> 00:00:26,775
royal subjects

9
00:00:27,986 --> 00:00:29,695
Here it is Here it is

10
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:33,866
The only thing worse than
the mindless adolescent direction

11
00:00:34,075 --> 00:00:38,871
was Joseph Tribbianis disturbingly
unskilled portrayal of the king

12
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:41,582
Okay look
That is one guys opinion

13
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:44,460
 All right Pheebs read yours
 Okay

14
00:00:44,669 --> 00:00:48,297
The only thing worse than the mindless
adolescent direction

15
00:00:48,506 --> 00:00:50,549
Does anybody have one
from a different paper

16
00:00:52,093 --> 00:00:53,302
Ross read yours

17
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:55,345
I dont want to

18
00:00:56,973 --> 00:01:00,350
Joey honey they dont know
what theyre talking about

19
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:01,852
Maybe they do

20
00:01:02,103 --> 00:01:05,064
Ive been doing this 10 years
and I havent gotten anywhere

21
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:06,273
Theres gotta be a reason

22
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:08,734
Come on man youre just uh
paying your dues

23
00:01:08,943 --> 00:01:11,111
No no no Its too hard

24
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:13,238
Its not worth it I quit

25
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:14,698
 What
 Thats crazy

26
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:17,284
Wait wait one minute Wait a minute

27
00:01:17,535 --> 00:01:20,245
I believe this will change your mind

28
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:25,709
In a mediocre play Joseph Tribbiani was
able to achieve brilliant new levels of

29
00:01:25,877 --> 00:01:27,544
Continued on page 153

30
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:29,546
sucking

31
00:02:17,428 --> 00:02:19,429
When I was little
I wanted to be a veterinarian

32
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:23,016

I guess I could sleep with her
I mean

269
00:15:37,811 --> 00:15:39,187
How can I do that

270
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:43,232
Well Ive got a popup book
that told me everything I needed to know

271
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:46,194
Ive never slept with someone for a part

272
00:15:46,403 --> 00:15:47,528
Well is she

273
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:50,865

00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:54,202
 Is she goodlooking
 Yeah

275
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:57,538
Shes totally goodlooking

Id be buying her breakfast

277
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:03,795
You know after having slept with her

278
00:16:09,426 --> 00:16:11,636
You know maybe this isnt
such a big deal

279
00:16:11,845 --> 00:16:17,350
I mean the way that I see it is you get
a great job and you get to have sex

280
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:20,561
You know Throw in a tree and a fat guy
and youve got Christmas

281
00:16:24,024 --> 00:16:28,194
I just I just dont think
that I want it that way though you know

282
00:16:28,445 --> 00:16:30,905
I mean lets say I do make it all right

283
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:34,283
Im always gonna look back and wonder
if it was because of my talent

284
00:16:34,451 --> 00:16:37,370
or because of you know
the little general

285
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:42,750
Didnt you used to call it the little major

286
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:45,753

287
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:53,261
Can I get you something from the bar

288
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:55,221

289
00:16:56,223 --> 00:16:58,307

364
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:03,636
Sometimes I like to hold stuff like this
and pretend Im a giant

365
00:21:08,141 --> 00:21:10,893
 Hey
 Hey Howd the callback go

366
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:14,855
Ugh it was unbelievable
I walked in there and she was all over me

367
00:21:15,065 --> 00:21:17,149
 So what did you do
 Well I couldnt do it

368
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:20,278
 I told her I didnt want the part that way
 Good for you

369
00:21:20,487 --> 00:21:22,822
Oh wait wait wait
But then after I left her office

370
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:26,367
she caught up with me at the elevator
and offered me an even bigger part

371
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:27,743
So and

372
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:33,916
So you are now looking
at Dr Drake Ramoray neurosurgeon

373
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:36,127
recurring in at least four episodes

374
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:37,795
All right

375
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:39,755

376
00:21:53,186 --> 00:21:54,520

380
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:03,612

too much of somebody

381
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:05,614
