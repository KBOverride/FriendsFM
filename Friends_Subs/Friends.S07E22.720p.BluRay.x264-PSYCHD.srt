7
00:00:22,772 --> 00:00:23,814

00:00:23,982 --> 00:00:26,942

17
00:01:02,937 --> 00:01:07,483
I wont let you drive the Porsche
because youre a terrible driver

18
00:01:07,692 --> 00:01:10,319

19
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:16,825
If you want a ride in the Porsche
Ill take you around the block

20
00:01:16,993 --> 00:01:18,494

26
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:16,468
Youre fast and irresponsible
That adds up to a bad driver

27
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:20,222
In high school that added up
to head cheerleader

28
00:02:24,352 --> 00:02:27,813
Did you see the look
that girl just gave me huh

29
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:30,774

00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:03,473
Alimony

36
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:10,981
We still havent gotten an RSVP
from your dad

37
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:15,777
Oh right Um maybe thats because
I didnt send him an invitation

38

00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:24,203
I dont even know him
I havent seen him in years

40
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:26,914
And when he finds out he wasnt asked

41
00:03:27,081 --> 00:03:29,374
We dont run in the same circles

42
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:32,669
I hang out with you guys and he

43
00:03:32,837 --> 00:03:35,547

47
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:47,059

All kids are embarrassed

101
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:46,071
You need a new word
for what I went through

102
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:49,199
In high school
he came to all my swim meets

103
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:52,577
dressed as a Hollywood starlet

104
00:06:53,037 --> 00:06:54,121
Its hard enough to be 14

105
00:06:54,288 --> 00:06:58,417
Youre skinny wearing Speedos
your mom promised youd grow into

106
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:04,047
You look up in the stands
Theres your dad cheering you on

107
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:08,135
Dressed as Carmen Miranda
wearing a headdress with real fruit

00:07:08,302 --> 00:07:12,848
that hell later give to your friends
as a healthy snack

109
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:18,270
The point is that he was at every one
of your swim meets cheering you on

110
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:20,397
Thats a pretty great dad

111
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:22,524
He had sex with Mr Garibaldi

112
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:25,986
Whos Mr Garibaldi

113
00:07:27,738 --> 00:07:29,072
Chandler

114
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:34,077
Youre not 14 anymore okay
Maybe its time you let that stuff go

115
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:40,542
If hes not at your wedding
youll regret it for the rest of your life

116
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:45,714
Okay but Im just doing this for you

117
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:47,299
Yes

118
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:52,262
I never get to win anymore
How much did you ever win before

119
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:57,976
Pheebs
Hey

120
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:01,938
You know how uh when youre wearing pants
and you lean forward

121
00:08:02,106 --> 00:08:03,565
I check out your underwear

122
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:05,233
Yeah

123
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:08,111
Well when Jake did it
Mmhm

124
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:11,823
I saw that he was wearing
womens underwear

125
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:13,742
I know They were mine

126
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:15,660
Oh

127
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:17,078

128
00:08:17,246 --> 00:08:19,664
No no wait Thats weird

129
00:08:20,249 --> 00:08:23,668
We were goofing around
and I dared him to try them on

130
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:25,253
Thats weird

131
00:08:25,421 --> 00:08:29,257
Im wearing his briefs right now
Thats kind of hot

132
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:35,472
I think so too And that little flap
Great for holding my lipstick

133
00:08:40,561 --> 00:08:42,395
I wouldnt know about that

134
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:48,109
Jake says that womens underwear
is actually more comfortable

135
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:51,279
He loves how silk feels against his skin

136
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:55,700
Next hell say your high heels
are good for his posture

137
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:59,412
Theres nothing wrong with Jake
He is all man

138
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:01,331
I think more than you

139
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:05,377
He looked like a real lumberjack
in those pink lacies

140
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:10,674
Only a man completely secure
with his masculinity

141
00:09:10,841 --> 00:09:14,135
could walk around in womens underwear
I dont think you could

142
00:09:14,303 --> 00:09:18,348
I am secure with my masculinity
Okay whatever

143
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:21,101
Youve seen my huge stack of porn

144
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:27,190

145
00:09:27,441 --> 00:09:30,235

146
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:31,987

147
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:35,490
God I forgot how much I love driving

148
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:38,368
