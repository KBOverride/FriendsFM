Youre such an amazing actor

114

How do you know where
Dr Drake Ramoray leaves off

115
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:15,100
and Joey Tribbiani begins

116
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:18,645
Well with Dr Drake

117
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:21,606
they always tell me what to say

118
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:28,113
And with Joey I pretty much have to
make it up on my own

119
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:30,574
Wow
Mm

120
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:32,868

00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:43,920
Here you go Let me ask you a question
Whoops Yeah

00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:49,509
someone told you
just how beautiful you are

126
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:52,053
Wow

127
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:54,264
I cant feel my hands

128
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:57,559
Come on Come here

129
00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:03,106
Huh

130
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:04,983

00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:19,748

132
00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:23,376

133
00:08:27,965 --> 00:08:29,341

136
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:38,934
If If If we did do this
thered be a lot of pressure on me

137
00:08:39,101 --> 00:08:43,522
Because youve waited a long time
and I wouldnt want to disappoint you

138
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:45,565
But I have nothing to compare it to

139
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:48,401
So even if you were horrible
how would I know

140
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:51,821
I do like that

141
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:55,200
Its harder for me
I have four women to compete with

142
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,702
Well if it helps there were only three

143
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:01,248

There are some men
who will stand by and watch

321
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:55,258
as their wives engage in what can
only be described as a twosome

322
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:58,928
with some woman she barely knows
from the gym

323
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:02,140
Who are these men

324
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:04,725
Just men A guy I know

You should be with me

342
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:25,306

351
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:09,892
There was just one woman

354
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:25,074
To finally make you see

355
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:30,329
One of them wont do it
But the second will set you free

356
00:21:32,874 --> 00:21:37,586
Tell all your hate and anger
Its time to say goodbye

357
00:21:37,754 --> 00:21:40,214
And that is just what I will do

358
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:43,175
