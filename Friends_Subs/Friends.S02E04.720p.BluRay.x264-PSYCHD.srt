You have a third nipple

55
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:49,770

56
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:54,608

57
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:59,071
No come on Theres nothing to see
Its just a tiny bump Its totally useless

58
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,531
Oh as opposed to your other
multifunctional nipples

59
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:07,162
I cant believe you
You told me it was a nubbin

60
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:11,041

61
00:04:12,168 --> 00:04:15,879

00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:19,800
 Let me see it again

63
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:21,176
Joey was in a porno movie

64
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:27,975
If Im going down
Im taking everybody with me

65
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:31,228
 Oh my God
 You were in a porno

66
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:34,690
All right all right
I was young and I just wanted a job okay

67
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:36,984
But at the last minute
I couldnt go through with it

68
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:40,320
So they let me be the guy who comes in
to fix the copier but cant

69
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:43,198
because theres people
having sex on it

70
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:44,700
Wow

71
00:04:44,867 --> 00:04:46,076
That is wild

72
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:49,579
 So whats it shaped like
 Is there a hair on it

73
00:04:49,872 --> 00:04:51,748
What happens if you flick it

So uh does it do anything
you know special

75
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:06,388
Why yes Ross pressing my third nipple
opens the delivery entrance

76
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,849
to the magical land of Narnia

77
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:14,521
You know in some cultures having
a third nipple is actually a sign of virility

78
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:17,524
You get the best huts
and women dance naked around you

79
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:22,195
Huh Are uh any of these cultures
per chance in the TriState area

80
00:05:22,905 --> 00:05:27,409
You know you are so amazing
Is there anything you dont know

81
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:32,831
Ooh Julies so smart Julies so special

82
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:36,835

with Ross as much as you did

83
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:40,464
But hes with her now
Youre just gonna have to get over it

84
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:43,467

86
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:52,017

For your information Im going to see him
so I can put all those feelings behind me

96
00:06:23,132 --> 00:06:26,676
And the reason Im dressed like this
is because I think its nice

97
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:29,346
to look nice for your gay husband

98
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:33,475

 No
 Wow

116
00:07:50,344 --> 00:07:52,137
Is it because shes so cold in bed

117
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:58,393
Or is it because shes kind of bossy
makes it feel like school

118
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:03,356
No No Shes great And its not
like we havent done anything

119
00:08:03,524 --> 00:08:08,028
I mean we do plenty of other stuff
Lots of other stuff like

123
00:08:16,412 --> 00:08:19,456
You know Ive only been
with one woman my whole life

124
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:21,875
and she turned out to be a lesbian

125
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:23,084
Uhhuh

126
00:08:23,252 --> 00:08:26,755
So now Ive got myself all psyched out

127
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:29,466
Its become like this

128
00:08:30,718 --> 00:08:32,677

00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:37,057

Sexy

135
00:08:50,738 --> 00:08:52,864
Let me tell you something
As a woman

136
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:56,159
there is nothing sexier

137
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:59,079
than a man who does not
want to have sex

138
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,708
 No kidding
 Oh yeah In fact you know what Id do

139
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:05,335
Id wait

140
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:10,131
 Youd wait
 Yes absolutely I would wait

141
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,425

142
00:09:13,427 --> 00:09:15,136
Then Id wait some more

143
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:18,640
 Really
 Oh yeah

144
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:21,810
I dont care how much she tells you
she wants it I dont care if she begs

145
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:26,815
she pleads she tells you
shes gonna have sex with another man

146
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:28,692
That just means its working

147
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:34,322
Women really want this

148
00:09:34,615 --> 00:09:36,324
More than jewelry

149
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:53,925

Basically he told me to get over myself
and just do it

180
00:11:46,997 --> 00:11:49,916
So I thought about what you said

216
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:13,601
What

217
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:15,812
Oh God
I dont know how to tell you this

218
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:19,357
Im straight

219
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:22,652
Yeah I know

220
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:27,156
I dont understand I dont understand
How can you be straight

221
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:29,826
I mean youre so smart and funny

222
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:32,912
and you throw
such great Academy Award parties

223
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:35,498
I know Thats what I kept telling myself

224
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:38,543
But you just reach a point
where you cant live a lie anymore

225
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:42,755
So how long have you known

226
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:47,886
I guess on some level
I always knew I was straight

227
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:50,930
I thought I was supposed
to be something else

228
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:55,894
You know Im an ice dancer all my
friends are gay I was just trying to fit in

229
00:14:57,688 --> 00:15:01,858
And um And theres actually a woman

230
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:05,486
 Her names Debra
 Oh

231
00:15:07,531 --> 00:15:10,450
Well is she the first
that youve been with

232
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:13,870
Well Ive never told you this

233
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:19,584
but there were one or two times
back in college

234
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:21,920
when Id get really drunk
and go to a straight bar

235
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:24,380
and wake up with a woman next to me

236
00:15:24,548 --> 00:15:29,761
But I told myself it was the liquor
and everyone experiments in college

237
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:32,347
Sure

238
00:15:32,556 --> 00:15:35,767
But now I know I dont have a choice
about this I was born this way

239
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:41,230
I dont know what to say

240
00:15:41,398 --> 00:15:44,400
I mean you know
youre married to someone for six years

241
00:15:44,568 --> 00:15:46,069
and you think you know him

242
00:15:46,236 --> 00:15:49,280
And then one day he says
Oh Im not gay

243
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:56,871
Im Im still me

244
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:02,418
Why couldnt you just have
figured this out six years ago

245
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:07,632
You know
it still smells like monkey in there

246
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:12,220
Well that saves us the conversation

247
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:16,808

And then maybe um
brush the hair away from my face

328
00:21:05,305 --> 00:21:09,392
And then look far into my eyes

329
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:12,311
in a way that lets me
know something

330
00:21:13,563 --> 00:21:15,815
