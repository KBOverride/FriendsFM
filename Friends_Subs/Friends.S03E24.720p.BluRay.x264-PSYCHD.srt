Thank you My boss keeps slapping my
butt and acting like its no big deal

81
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:05,178
Whatd you do about it

82
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:08,140
I didnt do anything
I didnt want to be the guy

83
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:11,226
who has a problem with his boss
slapping his bottom

84
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:15,397
I gotta tell you I think its okay
to be that guy

85
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:17,899
Maybe its that jock thing

86
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:21,862
You know how football players
pat each other after touchdowns

87
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:26,283
You know I dont understand guys

88
00:05:26,534 --> 00:05:29,995
I mean I would never congratulate
Monica on a great stew

89
00:05:30,204 --> 00:05:32,456
by you know grabbing her boob

90
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:36,501
I know For a really great stew
youd just

91
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:38,545
stick your head in between them

92
00:05:40,256 --> 00:05:41,673
Can we please go eat

93
00:05:41,924 --> 00:05:45,010
Yeah what are we getting
Anything but stew

94
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:49,514
So from now on dont give
your boss a chance to get you

95
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:51,475
Dont turn your back to him

96
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:54,644
Or you could teach him
a lesson you know

97
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:59,483
What you do is rub something that
smells really bad on your butt right

98
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:03,070
Then when he goes to smack you
his hand will smell

99
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:09,493
Now what could you rub on your butt
that would smell bad

100
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:14,498
What if Joey was President

101
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:19,294
Can I ask you something

102
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:21,755
Yeah

103
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:26,009
but would it be okay with you
if I set Ross up on a date

104
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:29,096
Oh Uh with who

105
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:32,182

106
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:35,060

107
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:37,979

118

Monica

204
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:29,831
Can I just tell you how proud
I am of you

205
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:34,085
It would be nice after hearing
20,000 people chant, "You suck!"

206
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:37,297
I thought you were nuts at first

207
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:39,090
but you did it

208
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:42,510
Now you can just look back at this
with no regrets

209
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:44,179
Look back

210
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:46,848
Youre not gonna keep going

211
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:50,935
Let me ask you a question
Am I the Ultimate Fighting Champion

212
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:54,689
Well no But

213
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:58,276
Im not gonna stop until Im
the Ultimate Fighting Champion

214
00:12:59,361 --> 00:13:03,156
That guy stood on your neck
until you passed out

215
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:05,658
Let me tell you a story

216
00:13:06,535 --> 00:13:10,872
When I set out to create MOSS 865
do you think it happened overnight

217
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:15,543
No There was MOSS 1
that burned down my dads garage

218
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:19,714
There was MOSS 2 that would only
schedule appointments in January

219
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:22,217
And 862 others that I learned from

220
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:26,221
Just like I learned from this fight
never to let a guy stand on my neck

221
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:28,723
You didnt know that already

222
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:32,227
Look Im gonna get better

223
00:13:33,103 --> 00:13:35,188
Okay I promise you

224
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:37,565
Okay

225
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:41,236

226
00:13:41,695 --> 00:13:43,071
Fast

227
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:46,324
One other thing

228
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:50,245
Hoshi thinks you being ringside
may have affected my concentration

229
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,247
Yeah

230
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,249
That was the problem

231
00:14:00,881 --> 00:14:03,758
How long until Petes fight
About five minutes

232
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:05,718
Theyre interviewing his opponent

233
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:10,056
Apparently he trains by going to Iran
and pulling the arms off thieves

234
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:13,601
Wow Ha ha Hot dog
Four please

235
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:15,770

Thank you

237
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:23,194
So how did it go with Bonnie

238
00:14:23,445 --> 00:14:27,615
Oh I gotta tell you
I wasnt expecting to like her at all

239
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:30,785
I actually wasnt expecting
to like anyone right now

240
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:33,079
But shes really terrific

241
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:34,289
Its too bad

242
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:39,168
No Im saying I liked her

243
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,296
There are other fish in the sea

244
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:45,800
I think shes great okay
Were going out again

245
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:49,637

of talking about anything else

246
00:14:51,473 --> 00:14:53,474
Which ones my turkey burger

247
00:14:53,767 --> 00:14:55,977

Fights starting
Well be right in

249
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,317
So did your boss try
to slap you again today

250
00:15:02,484 --> 00:15:03,985
Nine times

251
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,446
I had to put on lotion

252
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:11,492
But itll be okay
Tomorrow I conduct an experiment

253
00:15:11,785 --> 00:15:15,747
And if all goes as planned
my butt will be smackfree

254
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:17,624
JOEY

255
00:15:23,213 --> 00:15:24,672
Excuse me Doug

256
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:29,135
Hey there sports fan

Bing You got those numbers for me

258
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:34,098

259
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:36,225
Oh You forgot

260
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:38,937
No I just didnt do them

261
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:42,857
Instead I hung out with some
friends and had a couple of beers

262
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:45,818
So I certainly dont
deserve praise Verbal

263
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:47,654
or otherwise

264
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:51,366
I got tanked myself last night

265
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:54,035

267
00:15:58,874 --> 00:16:01,125
Doug
Hmm

268
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:05,838
Im a little bit uncomfortable with
the way that you express yourself

269
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:08,633
Is it the swearing
Is it the constant swearing

270
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:12,845
Because I gotta tell you if it is
you can just kiss my ass

271
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:17,642
No Its not about the swearing
Its more about

272
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:20,353
the way that you occasionally

273
00:16:20,562 --> 00:16:24,065
concentrate your enthusiasm

274
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:26,901
on my buttocks

275
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:29,320
Oh

276
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:32,281
Dont get me wrong
I appreciate the sentiment

277
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:36,327
Its just that I have a rather
sensitive posterior

278
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:41,416
And besides its making
all the other guys jealous

279
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:45,670
Well say no more You know
it takes guts to bring this up

280
00:16:45,921 --> 00:16:47,880
Bing youre okay

281
00:16:48,048 --> 00:16:49,090

00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:54,846

285
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:01,728
Would you rather live in the
shirt pocket of a sweaty giant

286
00:17:01,937 --> 00:17:04,439
or inside his shower drain

287
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:07,734

I hope he lets her down easy

292
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:29,255
Look at that They are not
breaking up Look at them

293
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:32,467
You know what that is
A second date thats what that is

294
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:35,470
Look she just put her hand
on his thigh

296
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:39,599

298
00:17:45,355 --> 00:17:46,856

So

310
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:34,779
Its just you know I didnt
expect him to be this happy so soon

311
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:37,990

312
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:45,498
Oh no

315
00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:00,471

316
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:02,140

317
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:05,935
Its not as bad as it looks
Its a precaution

318
00:19:06,186 --> 00:19:08,688
Im not supposed to move my spine

319
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:13,067

322
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:22,702
This is my Zone of Terror

323
00:19:25,455 --> 00:19:28,833
You are insane
Youve got to give this up

324
00:19:29,042 --> 00:19:31,961
I cant until Im
the Ultimate Fighter

325
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:33,337
I will do it

326
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:37,842
The day will come when children will
argue over who will win a fight

327
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:40,011
me or Superman

328
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:44,891
Not that I could beat Superman
but kids are stupid

329
00:19:46,101 --> 00:19:47,393
Just sit down

330
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:49,478
Please listen to me

331
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:54,692
You are terrible at this okay You

332
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:56,110
Ever

333
00:19:57,571 --> 00:20:01,616
I have a torn rotator cuff a hairline
fracture in my right forearm

334
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:05,995
and a severely bruised Adams
apple but that really hurt

335
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:13,878
Well then you know what

336
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:20,092
I care about you too much to watch you
hurt yourself like this

337
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:24,013
So if you have to do this
youll have to do it without me

338
00:20:24,514 --> 00:20:26,432
If youre asking me to quit

339
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:29,518
then youre asking me
to be someone Im not

340
00:20:29,811 --> 00:20:31,270
Ive got to do this

341
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:37,443
