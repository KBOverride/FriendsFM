93
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:13,723
You know I was thinking
what if I uh unpack here

94
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:15,684
Then all your stuff would be here

95
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:19,354
Well

96
00:07:22,024 --> 00:07:23,733
What if it was here

97
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:27,487
Then youd be going back

98
00:07:28,072 --> 00:07:29,573
Doesnt make any sense

99
00:07:30,074 --> 00:07:31,658
Okay

100
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:37,164
What if we live together

101
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:48,717
We wanted to surprise you

102
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:00,687
Oh my God

103
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:08,778
Chandler

104
00:08:09,947 --> 00:08:11,907

105
00:08:12,783 --> 00:08:15,452
I never thought Id be so lucky

106
00:08:18,956 --> 00:08:22,584
as to fall in love with my best

107
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:23,919

108
00:08:24,086 --> 00:08:28,131

why girls dont do this

109
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:30,425
Okay okay okay Ill do it

110
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:33,386
I thought

111
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:39,184
I can do this

112
00:08:40,561 --> 00:08:42,145

113
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:44,648
I thought

114
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:50,070
that it mattered what I said
or where I said it

115
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:55,909
Then I realized the only thing
that matters is that you

116
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:04,251
You make me happier
than I ever thought I could be

117
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:09,548
And if you let me

118
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:14,052
Ill spend the rest of my life
trying to make you feel the same way

119
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:24,604
Monica

120
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,066

The lying and the secrets
will be over

195
00:13:44,865 --> 00:13:49,536
