ticket to the Knicks game

41
00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:16,111

43
00:03:20,241 --> 00:03:21,491

46
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:29,666

00:03:45,141 --> 00:03:49,561
He keeps his fingers to himself

54
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:53,315
Richards really nice
Uh we just dont know him really well

55
00:03:53,524 --> 00:03:55,234
Plus hes old

56
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:59,988
 er than some people

57
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:03,075
But uh younger than some buildings

58
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:07,704
So what hes a little older
Big deal

59
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:09,498
Hes important to me

60
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:12,626
If you ask him
he might take you in his Jag

61
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:18,590
How do we say yes

62
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:21,593
and make it seem like its not
just to ride in the cool car

63
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:25,264
Okay this could be tough

64
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:28,225
Okay okay okay Monica

65
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:31,895
Well bring him
but only if he takes the Jaguar

66
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:36,275

You are not gonna believe
what happened

71
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:54,876
We were playing on the floor
and he grabs the table

72
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:57,087
and he pulls himself up

73
00:04:58,589 --> 00:05:00,674
He pulled himself up

74
00:05:00,883 --> 00:05:02,384
Standing man

75
00:05:03,594 --> 00:05:07,264
Im sorry you missed it
but I did tape it if you wanna see it

76
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:10,392
Uh we know

77
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:12,728
You can watch our tape if you want

78
00:05:12,895 --> 00:05:17,316
Ah see I dont believe this
I missed the first time of everything

79
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:20,736
The first time he rolled over
the first time he crawled

80
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:23,280
What else Has he spoken
Is he driving

81
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:26,158
Does he have a favorite liqueur

82
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:28,827
He is getting closer
on the talking thing

83
00:05:29,078 --> 00:05:32,372
He cant quite say mama yet
but once he said Yemen

84
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:36,376

and she said my mom used to not
show us the ends of sad movies

100
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:29,388
to shield us from
the pain and sadness

101
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:32,182
You know before she killed herself

102
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:35,852

Its cute you trying
to be more like Richard

136
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:25,670
Not like him per se

137
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:28,048
Just not unlike him

138
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:40,810

You know a boy and a girl

180
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:55,820
Hopefully the girl will come first
so Ben wont feel competitive

181
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,408
Then whats gonna happen

182
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:04,663

One minute Im holding Ben

250
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:33,663
Im living in Scarsdale
complaining about taxes

251
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:36,499
Well Im sorry
I think about stuff

252
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:40,545
Youre at work youre assembling bones
your mind wanders

253
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:44,382
Youve planned out the next 20 years
Weve dated for six weeks

254
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,467
You never think about our future

255
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:49,762
I think about whose apartment
well sleep at tomorrow

256
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:52,098
and where well have dinner
next Saturday

257
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:54,851
I do not think about
our childrens names

258
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:58,813
You know what our
childrens names will be

259
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:00,481
Ha ha no

00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:04,277
No I mean you know I read a book
and there was a girl named Emily

261
00:15:04,486 --> 00:15:06,696
And I thought that might be good

262
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:09,574
What was the book

263
00:15:10,826 --> 00:15:12,702
The Big Book of Childrens Names

264
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:15,163

What we have is amazing

267
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:21,252
But I do not want
everything decided for me

268
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,046
I spent my whole life like that

269
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:25,924
Its what I had with Barry
Thats a reason I left

270
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:28,092

Youre with a guy who wont stop
planning his future with you

275
00:15:41,565 --> 00:15:43,399
He knows well end up together

276

I dont know if I was happier when

the pharmacist made his ear bleed

286
00:16:17,017 --> 00:16:19,978
Ill give you the ear thing
but wasnt the ending wonderful

287
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:22,313

296
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:48,464
We had a table in college

297
00:16:48,632 --> 00:16:50,967
Oh really I didnt know they had
foosball in the 1800s

298
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:55,847
Nice mustache At puberty

317
00:17:56,116 --> 00:18:00,244
Youre just clearly not familiar
with our young persons vernacular

318
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:03,831
When we say dad we mean buddy

319
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:06,542
 We mean pal

320
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:09,337

00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:30,233
 Youre not a dad
 Youre not a dad

328
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,652

329
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:39,742
So are you okay

331
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:43,204
Just

332
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:45,832
I feel like Im about a hundred

333
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:49,168

334
00:18:49,753 --> 00:18:50,962

You take the poopy diaper
and put it in the poopy diaper pail

342
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:19,365
Calling it a poopy diaper
doesnt make this process any cuter

Hey Bert

isnt this a nice hole here

00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:43,342
Okay ahem

394
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:48,055
Ben this is the part where Ernie buries
Bert in the sand and cant find him

395
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:53,769
Now Ive looked ahead on the tape
and he does find him again

396
00:21:54,896 --> 00:21:58,524
But before that happens
theres some rough going for a while

397
00:21:58,734 --> 00:22:00,818
But I think we can handle it

398
00:22:01,069 --> 00:22:06,198
And theres just the alphabet
but we know that ends well so

399
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:07,742
Here we go

400
00:22:07,951 --> 00:22:09,327
