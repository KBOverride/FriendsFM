Why would they do that
It was a good show right

269
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:14,746
You want to tell secrets
Okay in college

270
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:17,123
Ross used to wear leg warmers

271
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:18,791

272
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:24,505
All right Chandler entered a Vanilla Ice
lookalike contest and won

273
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:28,468
Ross came in fourth and cried

274
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:30,470
Oh my God

275
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:33,723
Oh is that funny
You find that funny

276
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:36,809
Maybe Chandler should know
your secrets too

277
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:39,270
Ha ha
Oh I I already told him everything

278
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:41,105
You shush

279
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:44,359
Once she was sent to bed
without dinner

280
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:47,570
so she ate the macaroni off
a jewelry box shed made

281
00:15:50,407 --> 00:15:54,077
Ross stayed home every Saturday night
to watch Golden Girls

282
00:15:56,538 --> 00:15:59,165
Monica couldnt tell time
until she was 1 3

283
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:03,503
Its hard for some people

284
00:16:04,254 --> 00:16:05,922
Of course it is

285
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:08,132

286
00:16:08,592 --> 00:16:11,678
Chandler wore my underwear to work

287
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:16,474
Oh Im sorry I couldnt think
of any more for Ross

288
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:18,476
In college Chandler got drunk

289
00:16:18,727 --> 00:16:20,728
and slept with the lady
who cleaned our dorm

290
00:16:20,896 --> 00:16:21,980

291
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:23,564

What happened

299
00:16:46,797 --> 00:16:51,968
Well maybe I got a little upset and
maybe I told them where they could go

300
00:16:52,469 --> 00:16:54,679
Joey why would you do that

301
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:57,390
