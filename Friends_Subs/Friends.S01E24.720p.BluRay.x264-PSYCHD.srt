151
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,760
but nothing ever happened
so I just

152
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:40,138
What else did he say
Does he want to go out with me

153
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:42,515
Given that hes desperately
in love with you

154
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:45,810
he wouldnt mind getting
a cup of coffee or something

155
00:10:46,562 --> 00:10:47,771
Ross

156
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:50,106

00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:17,759

214
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:29,200
Thought about it
all of the way there

215
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:32,579
and I thought about it
all the way back and uh

216
00:14:32,788 --> 00:14:34,539
You know its Ross

217
00:14:34,748 --> 00:14:37,041

my initial gut feeling

220
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:46,885

00:14:57,521 --> 00:14:59,647
Its like starting on the 15th date

225
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:03,318
But it would be like
starting on the 15th date

226
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:06,112
Another good point

227
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:07,906
No I mean

228
00:15:08,115 --> 00:15:12,535
At the 15th date youre already
in a relationshipy place

229
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:13,953
Youre committed

230
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:17,040
Huh

231
00:15:17,499 --> 00:15:19,834
What happens if it doesnt work out

232
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:23,046
 Why isnt it working out

233
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:26,966

Does he not make enough money

234
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:29,344
 No Im just
 Maybe theres someone else

235
00:15:29,553 --> 00:15:32,221

236
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:35,600

00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:38,186

Shes still asleep

241
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:58,456
 So howd it go
 It was amazing

242
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:00,708
You know how you think
youre great in bed

243
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:04,587
The fact youd even ask
shows how little you know me

244
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:07,882
Well its like
last night I couldnt do the thing

245
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:10,009
that usually makes me great

246
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:12,345
So I had to do all this other stuff

247
00:16:12,554 --> 00:16:15,598
And the response I got Man oh man

248
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:17,976
It was like a tickertape parade

249
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:23,564
Yes I know As it happens my room
is very close to the parade route

250
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:33,032
It was amazing and not just for her
Uhuh For me too

251
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:36,327
Its like all of a sudden Im blind

252
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:38,705
but all my other senses
are heightened

253
00:16:38,914 --> 00:16:42,542
You know Its like
I was able to appreciate it

254
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:44,794
on another level

255
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:49,841
I didnt know you had another level

256
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:52,176

257
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:03,938

00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:08,067
I exchanged the blouse you got me

260
00:17:09,778 --> 00:17:11,362
Well its the thought

262
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:16,743

Uh yeah

264
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,540
Monica you know
Ive been thinking about it

265
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:26,127
Ive decided this Ross thing
is not a good idea

266
00:17:26,336 --> 00:17:28,171
 Why
 Because I feel

267
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,923
like I wouldnt
just be going out with him

268
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:33,217
I would be going out with all of you

269
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:37,013
 Ugh thered be all this pressure and
 No pressure no pressure

270
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:41,809
Nothing has even happened yet

272
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:45,772
I was a teensy bit weird at first

273
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:48,858
but Ill be good I promise

274
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:55,156
Who is it

275
00:17:55,365 --> 00:17:56,699

285
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:41,452
When a blind man gets his sight back

 Youre like my best friend

305
00:19:52,399 --> 00:19:54,358
 If we broke up and I lost you

Why do you think well break up

307
00:19:56,612 --> 00:20:00,489
Have you been involved with someone
where you havent broken up

308
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:04,702
No

309
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:08,623
But it only has to happen once

310
00:20:08,957 --> 00:20:12,001
You and I know

311
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:13,419
