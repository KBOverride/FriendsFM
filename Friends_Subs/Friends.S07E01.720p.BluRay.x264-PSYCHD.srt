I waited my whole life to be engaged

167
00:11:01,952 --> 00:11:05,121
And unlike some

168
00:11:07,124 --> 00:11:12,253

00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:24,107
Yeah and if you want to look 1 9 then you

261
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:26,943
You got to do something about your eyes

262

Whats wrong with my eyes

263
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:32,490
They give you away
Theres too much wisdom in there

264
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:39,080
Put some tea bags on them for 1 5 minutes

265
00:16:39,289 --> 00:16:42,709
Thatll get rid of my wisdom
Maybe 1 0 minutes for you

00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:49,215

00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:18,036
Monica what are you talking about

276
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:21,414
My sweet 1 6 You went to third base

277
00:17:21,623 --> 00:17:23,875
Ah third base

278
00:17:24,918 --> 00:17:27,128
It was all everybody could talk about

279
00:17:27,337 --> 00:17:31,340
The only reason I did that
was because your party was so boring

280
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:32,675

281
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:35,094
We had a caricaturist

00:17:37,097 --> 00:17:40,600
Guess who wont be asked to sing

283
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:45,271
Somebody named Geller
And somebody else named Bing

284
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:52,653
Monica your sweet 1 6
was like a million years ago

285
00:17:52,863 --> 00:17:54,614

286
00:17:54,823 --> 00:17:57,158
Oh I dont want to steal your stupid thunder

287
00:17:57,409 --> 00:18:00,244

No one was supposed to see us

293
00:18:15,844 --> 00:18:19,555
Is that why you did it in the secret hallway
where nobody ever goes

294
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:22,975
Uh Rachel Ive been thinking

295
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:27,522
